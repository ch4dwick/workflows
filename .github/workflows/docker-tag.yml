          # Use case: Anyone can build and deploy but all staging and prod commits/merges SHOULD be tagged.
          # Once a dev tag is merged, staging and prod tags SHOULD be the same but with the suffix ending
          # with the environment. e.g. 1.2.3-dev SHOULD have a corresponding 1.2.3-staging and so on.
          # 1 Get the tag name from the push tag event.
          # 2 Tag an image as 'dev' if a change was pushed in dev. Always triggered on push.
          # 3 Tag an image as staging or prod if suffixed accordingly.
          # 4 Tag an image as stable if semver-tagged with prod.
